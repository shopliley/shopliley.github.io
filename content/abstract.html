        <p><p style="text-align: center; white-space: pre-line;">
    It's 11:33 PM . 28/10/2024. and I am still missing you so much.<br>
    I miss each and every moment we were together.<br>
    I miss the way we sat on the beach and see the water level rise.<br>
    I miss the way we were drunk and you cried and promised me you will never leave.<br>
    I miss the way you put me in your lap and kiss me.<br>
    I miss the way we both cried watching a movie.<br>
    I miss the way we were together and you loved me so much.<br>
    I miss the way we spent so much time on shopping.<br>
    I miss the way we did so many weird things.
    I want to forget you so bad but I can not.<br><br>

    Baira movie herna jada, I wish you were by my side to experience the moment.<br>
    Kei kahana janxu, wish ki you could have a taste too.<br>
    Mero every happiness ma timlai samjhanxu still.<br><br>

    There is never a day, I went sleeping thinking about you, us, when we were happy.<br><br>

    You promised me to fight for our love, but when the time came you broke the promise.<br><br>

    Ma risaunu jahej thiyena ra? teti sab huda, but you never understood what I felt.<br>
    You felt guilty for what you did but never thought what pain it gave me.<br>
    I could have left everything, just to be with you.<br>
    I could have forgiven infinite times only if you had held my hands tighter.<br><br>

    Ma risuauxu, malai ni timi jastai risuthxa, but timlai hurt garne bitkiaki malai ni guilty hunxa.<br>
    You have no idea how much I love you.<br><br>

    I have promised myself, I made promise to you, that I will always love you and never leave you.<br><br>

    You can be angry with me, super angry, say bad words, say anything, ma ekxin risamla but at the end of the day I will still love you.<br>
    You can try anything to keep me away but I will always be near you.<br><br>
    
    I have so much pure feelings and love for you, which will never die until my heartbeat stops.<br>

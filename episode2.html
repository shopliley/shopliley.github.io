            <p>
                We always used to play together. When we were not in games, we used to be on call 24 hours. She had also started her small business which was going good. I was doing good with my studies. We were seeing the future together. But, her parents did not want us to talk as our caste was different. Even though we ignored it, we loved each other. Our calls used to be at least 12 hours on average. Even when we did not talk, the call was on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Later, we decided to team up to grow her business. We took a risk by sourcing products from China. We both invested in it, though the cost was higher than expected. But when the product arrived, we were happy and named the business "3011" after our matching birthdates. However, as time passed, her familyâ€™s pressure increased. We had to make the tough decision to stay friends, trying to avoid further pain while still holding on to our business partnership.

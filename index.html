        <h2>Episode 1</h2>
        <p>
            I used to play an online game called PUBG. I used to be on YouTube livestream. One day, my friend told me that there was a girl who always asked about me. Then one day, we played together. After that day, we became friends. Later, she requested to be my partner in the game. We always played together. Slowly, we started talking on social media. We started calling each other "babe." This is how our long-distance relationship started.
